## Getting up and running

In this chapter you're going to start with the basics, including starting a new project, adding UI for MVC to your project, and installing the quick start template.

### Create a new MVC project

UI for ASP.NET MVC can easily be added to an existing ASP.NET MVC project in just a few clicks using VisualStudio. 

Start by creating a new ASP.NET MVC project. You'll use this project throughout the rest of this tutorial to build your application.

### Install the quick start boilerplate

With the new project created, it's time to start building your app. For this guide, we've scaffolded out a boilerplate project to act as a starting point for the Team Efficiency Dashboard.

The boilerplate has an HTML page, the Northwind database and some server-side code you may find in a typical MVC project.

Exercise:

PM> Install-Package KendoQsBoilerplate
