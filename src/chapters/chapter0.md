### UI for ASP.NET MVC vs Kendo UI widgets

From client-side point of view, the vanilla HTML/JavaScript **Kendo UI** widgets and the rendered **UI for ASP.NET MVC** represent the same thing and provide the same capabilities.
However, the UI for ASP.NET MVC wrappers provide additional capaiblites for use with ASP.NET MVC and tooling for VisualStudio. Refer to the [documentation](http://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/aspnet-mvc/kendo-ui-vs-mvc-wrappers) for a complete feature comparison.
